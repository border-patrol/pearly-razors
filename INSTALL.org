#+TITLE: Building

* Building

To build and play with the examples we advise that you use the [[https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2][latest development version]] of Idris2 due to issues with Idris2 totality checker.

The complete set of examples can be type & termination checked by invoking:

#+begin_src bash
idris2 --build razor.ipg
#+end_src

The output should look something like:

#+begin_src bash
1/7: Building Razor.Common (Razor/Common.idr)
2/7: Building Razor.SystemFoo (Razor/SystemFoo.idr)
3/7: Building Razor.Variant.Unique (Razor/Variant/Unique.idr)
4/7: Building Razor.Variant (Razor/Variant.idr)
5/7: Building Razor.Recorded (Razor/Recorded.idr)
6/7: Building Razor.Tupled (Razor/Tupled.idr)
7/7: Building Razor.PLFA (Razor/PLFA.idr)
#+end_src

and take around 15 seconds to check:

#+begin_src bash

* Playing

You are free to augment the examples and extend the set of examples directly within the declared modules.
However, it would be better to create new example modules and import the languages.
